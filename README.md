# About

Designed to be:

- a low blue-light (dark theme), for better eye health, night-time use .etc
- Dyslexic friendly, through high monospace font (SF Mono is good, yet likeable by non-dyslexics also), as well as generally being visually easy through high-contrast .etc.

# Installation of Theme

Presently to be installed manually.

"Show Command Palette" - Ctrl/CMD + Shift + P

choose:

Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)

and add either over-write, or integrate into your own JSON if you have settings you like.

# Additional info

Built upon [Absolute Black](https://github.com/Tarik02/vscode-absolute-black), so you can install that as a fall-back if you really want... Otherwise it will fall-back to your default theme.

Uses the [SF Mono Nerd Font](https://github.com/epk/SF-Mono-Nerd-Font) as primary font, but has fall-back, usually monospace fonts.
